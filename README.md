## _❤️ Heart Disease Prediction System_ 

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health data using **Machine Learning** models.  
The dataset used is derived from the **UCI Cleveland Heart Disease dataset**. The system can help medical practitioners and researchers to identify patients at risk of heart disease early.

---
## ⚙️ Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, feature scaling  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations of trends, correlations, and distributions  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, etc.  
- **Model Evaluation:** Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC, Classification Report  
- **Model Persistence:** Save and load trained models for future predictions  
- **Deployment-Ready:** Ready for integration with Flask or Streamlit
